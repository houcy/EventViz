# EventViz

A web application to display log (or whatever parsable source) events in a timeline. It has a Flask based interface
and uses MongoDB for storage.

This application is not meant to be used as a log management tool, but more as an utility to provide an easy way
to visualize and make searches on a pre-filtered set of events of interest.

## Requirements

* Python 2.x
* MongoDB
* PyMongo
* Flask
* Flask-Script

Required Python modules can be installed using the provided `requirements.txt`.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

All the administration commands are implemented in the `manage.py` script. Commands switches meaning can
be viewed using `./manage.py <command> -h`, and available commands can be listed by calling the script
without any argument.

### Configuration

Default configuration variables are stored in the `settings.py` file. To prevent making changes to a versioned file,
you should create a `prod_settings.py` file where you'd override the options you want, it will be automatically loaded.

Here are the options **you really should change**:

* `DEBUG`: Displays `Werkzeug` integrated debugger when an exception is raised. Gives access to a Python shell
in the application's context. You really don't want that in a production environment!
* `SECRET_KEY`: The key used to sign cookies. Set this to a very long random value.

For the remaining configuration variables, just look at the `settings.py` file, it should be self-explanatory.

### Workflow

* Load some data using the `./manage.py load_data` command
* Run the integrated server using the `./manage.py runserver` command
* Connect to http://127.0.0.1:5000 with your web browser

### Deployment

To serve the application using something else than the integrated server (Apache, nginx, ...), please refer to
the related [Flask configuration](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/)
